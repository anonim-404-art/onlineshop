# Gadget Shop

This is my Gadget Shop project.  
My main focus in this project was building and implementing the **backend functionality**.  
⚠️ The **frontend design/template** was not created by me — it was provided as a ready-made template.

## Features (Backend)
- User authentication and session handling  
- Product management (view, add, delete, update)  
- Shopping cart functionality  
- Order processing logic  

## Tech Stack
- Python (Flask/Django/FastAPI – specify what you used)  
- SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite – specify your DB)  
- HTML templates integration  

## Notes
This repository demonstrates my backend development skills. The frontend code is included for project completeness, but the design is not my work.
